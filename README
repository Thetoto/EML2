Elves Must Live 2 is a parkour-platformer game, where your goal, as a traveller
entering the ennemy lines, is to get to the Princess Elf without getting killed
by the lava, by the Orcs lurking around, or by simply falling to your death.

In order to stay alive, you are equiped with a weapon that you can use with CTRL
You can move around using the ARROW KEYS.
You can jump by using the SPACEBAR.
The most important thing is that you can jump multiple times. How is this done?
Simply by hitting a wall or the floor. That's right! If, during your jump, you
collided with a wall, you will be able to jump another time. Use it carefuly!

Find the best way and save the princess by any means!
